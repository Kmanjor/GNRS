1.ID of the tested molecular phenotype (in this particular case, the gene ID)
2.Number of variants tested in cis for this phenotype
3.MLE of the shape1 parameter of the Beta distribution
4.MLE of the shape2 parameter of the Beta distribution
5.Dummy [To be described later]
6.ID of the best variant found for this molecular phenotypes (i.e. with the smallest p-value)
7.Distance between the molecular phenotype - variant pair
8.The nominal p-value of association that quantifies how significant from 0, the regression coefficient is.
9.The slope associated with the nominal p-value of association [only in version > v2-184]
10.A first permutation p-value directly obtained from the permutations with the direct method. This is basically a corrected version of the nominal p-value that accounts for the fact that multiple variants are tested per molecular phenotype.
11.A second permutation p-value obtained via beta approximation. We advice to use this one in any downstream analysis.
